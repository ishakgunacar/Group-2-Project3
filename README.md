# Section 1: Overview
The objective of our project was to create a sentiment-based Movie Recommendation app that utilized the power of OpenAI to suggest films and tv shows based on an arbitrary statement. For example, if a user were to input the statement, "I feel like watching a crime drama with a police officer as the main character," the app would ideally be able to process that sentiment and recommend a list of films and/or shows baesd on it.

The problem we were trying to alleviate was one where the user, although probably already utilizing different "watch lists" on several different streaming services, would be searching for something new that they had never heard of based on a notion (as opposed to searching by genre). Ideally our app would open them up to lesser-known prodcutions or even international productions of a similar ilk. Basically it would be a free-association approach to searching for something to watch.

Another consideration we had was for the user that didn't know what they wanted to watch and didn't want to waste time looking through their various "watch lists". This was a logistical concern for the user that may only have thrity minutes to an hour to relax at night before going to bed.
